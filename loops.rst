Loops
=====
Loops are used extensively in programs to repeat actions. The looping types can be based on several methods such as a counter counting until a value is reached, or iterating over the contents of a file.

========
For loop
========
A For loop is used to iterate over objects, with each iteration running through the code contained within the For loop.

==========
While loop
==========
A While loop checks for a condition, and if it does not meet the criteria, the loop will run. In some cases however, if the criteria is immediately met, the loop will not run at all and execution of the program will continue past the loop.

=============
Do-While loop
=============
A Do-While loop performs the comparison at the end of the loop. This means that the code in the loop is always executed at least once, with subsequent loop operations only being performed if the criteria is met.
