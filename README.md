The C Programming Tutorial aims to provide an up-to-date, simple-to-follow
tutorial on using C. Many of the existing tutorials available have not been
updated for many years, and do not indicate dangerous functions or current best
practices.

This tutorial aims to follow the latest C standard where possible.
